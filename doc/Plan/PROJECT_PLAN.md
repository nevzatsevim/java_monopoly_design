We have decided to divide the tasks in the following way:
Nevzat’s primary responsibility will be Visualization and the secondary responsibility will be helping Farzeen and Cemal with the backend or Parser whenever he is available.

Cemal’s primary responsibility will be managing Engine but right now he will work with Farzeen on both data and Engine till a clear distinction between the two is made.

Farzeen’s primary responsibility will be managing Engine but right now she will work with Cemal on both data and Engine till a clear distinction between the two is made.

We plan to get done with basic implementation early on during the first sprint and then work on it in the following weeks so it could afford the extensions.
